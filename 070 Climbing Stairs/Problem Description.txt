70. Climbing Stairs  (===LOGIC EXPLAINED AT THE END===)

    You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
    Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 45

>> This is an example of Fibonaci Series
>> FORMULA:  Ways to climb n stairs = ways to climb (n-1) stairs + ways to climb (n-2) stairs

>>EXAMPLE:
- If we are at 8th stair the we must reach to this stair either from 7th or 6th stairs as we can jump either 1 or 2 steps. So we can find the number of ways to reach n stairs by adding the ways to reach its (n-1) and (n-2) stairs.

- We already know the ways to climb 1st and 2nd stairs by manual calculation so we can find for 3 stairs using above formula and so on
